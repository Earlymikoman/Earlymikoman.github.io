            Noirish was my first real experience coding, before I went to school or
             anything, just opening Unity and trying to tutorial my way to something.
             The codebase isn't particularly impressive, really very very inefficient,
             inelegant, and just lacking all of what I would now call common sense.
             But, for all its technical flaws, I did wind up getting a working "demo" for
             it that, for the time, felt good enough to bolster my want to get into
             computer science.

        <h1>Excalibur Engine</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excalibur Engine is my homemade C++ engine I made over the summer to
             further my understanding of engine architecture. My primary
             goal with this engine was to be as efficient as possible; pure ECS,
             interrupt messaging, anything I could think of that would minimize
             unnecessary code as much as possible. For the most part this is now
             abandonware, but much of what I did here will definitely be carried
             over into my future projects, engine and no. One of the main general
             tools I learned while developing Excalibur was templates, which I now
             know that I love dearly. One such template class is the representative
             data type of the engine, the
             <a href="/Personal/Excalibur Engine/Jive.txt" download>
                Jive
            </a>
            .
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jive's purpose is to be the container for components; there were
            two hard rules for its development:
            <ol>
                <li>Objects should be stored contiguously.</li>
                <li>Pointers to the contents of the Jive should never become invalid.</li>
            </ol>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rules naturally lead to some other properties; objects inside the Jive
             never move, or else rule 2 would be broken, and since they never move, to
             iterate over them one must maintain a "recipe" for which of its contents are
             currently active. Additionally, since they are contiguous, the Jive is
             very fast at iteration for cache coherency, but also at deletion and
             insertion, particularly in a linear fashion (i.e., deleting from the
             front and pushing to the back at a constant rate is ideal).
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, so as to provide safety for the user, I did decide to allow
             the Jive to grow, just not through reallocation (rule 2), but by maintaining
             template-argument-sized arrays in a vector, which is admittedly technically
             not as fast as being strict about a "Component Cap" would let it be, but
             it seemed a minimal loss for dynamacism.
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messaging system for Excalibur is also a bit outdated now, as I was
             using type-erased void pointers to pass my arbitrary messages, but I now
             know I can templatize the message handlers to allow for much easier and
             safer use. It is slightly annoying to have to define a type for each message,
             but them's the breaks I suppose. Could be solved through macros or pre-build
             steps, I would think.
