        <p>
            Last Contact is my freshman game project, developed by the team Mod2 in C++:
            <ul>
                <li>Xander Boosinger</li>
                <li>Ori Balashov</li>
                <li>Elliot Orr</li>
                <li>Justin Ptacek</li>
                <li>Aidan Hartman</li>
            </ul>

            {{tab}}Last Contact being my first "real" project, a lot of our time was
             spent designing a fairly basic engine; lots of figuring out needling
             stuff like when to delete components,
             how to do update/render layers, how to render, how to separate component
             responsibilities cleanly.
            <br>{{tab}}Aside from that though, my biggest tasks were to implement the
             core mechanic, trains/tracks, and the user interface for placing those
             as such. I had started the semester
             thinking the trains would be easy, but I soon found that there were a
             number of edge cases I had to watch for, and I was really trying
             to get away with a any-time method;
             effectively, determining the direction the train should go on tracks
             based on the current status of both, rather than trying to maintain
             some kind of record to help determine the direction.
            <br>
            <br>{{tab}}The method I eventually went for to achieve was a bit
             hacked-together, but wound up working very well for the final project,
             and I'm not currently aware of any bugs
             relating to this code at the moment. More annoying than this,
             though, was the interface for placing the tracks; the UI itself
             was mostly fine, some memory bugs here and there,
             but what was really terrible was the logic for which way placed
             tracks should be pointing; this involved a lot of recursive
             searching in the tiles around the placed track,
             and took quite a lot of debugging to iron out the kinks.
             I believe there are definitely edge cases out there that
             would cause weird behaviour, but I can't come up with a
             specific example. I just know in my soul SOMETHING is probably broken.
            <br>
            <br>{{tab}}I used FMOD for the game's audio, and since I'd never used FMOD
             at all before it turned out pretty basic; pretty much, just PlaySound.
             I did a little bit more to get the audio
             to dropoff when the camera was far away from the source, but this was
             really cobbled together. I also made the music and processed the SFX,
             but the music was a bit janky and
             SFX processing isn't all too interesting to write about here.
