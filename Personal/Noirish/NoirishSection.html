            Excalibur Engine is my homemade C++ engine I made over the summer to
             further my understanding of engine architecture. My primary
             goal with this engine was to be as efficient as possible; pure ECS,
             interrupt messaging, anything I could think of that would minimize
             unnecessary code as much as possible. For the most part this is now
             abandonware, but much of what I did here will definitely be carried
             over into my future projects, engine and no. One of the main general
             tools I learned while developing Excalibur was templates, which I now
             know that I love dearly. One such template class is the representative
             data type of the engine, the Jive:[INSERT JIVE SCREENSHOT HERE]
            <br>
            The Jive's purpose is to be the container for components; there were
            two hard rules for its development:
            <ol>
                <li>a</li>
            </ol>
